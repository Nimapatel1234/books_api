# Book Retrieval API
This project implements a RESTful API for a book retrieval system using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The API allows searching for books based on various filter criteria, supporting pagination, and returning books in JSON format.

# Project Overview
The Book Retrieval API provides the following functionality:

Retrieve Books: Search for books based on zero or more filter criteria.

# Filter Options:

Book ID (Project Gutenberg ID numbers)
Language
Mime-type
Topic (filters on "subject" or "bookshelf" or both)
Author
Title
API Response:

Number of books matching the criteria.
A list of book objects with detailed information:
Title of the book
Information about the author
Genre
Language
Subject(s)
Bookshelf(s)
Download links for the book in available formats (mime-types).
Pagination: Retrieve books in sets of 25 if the results exceed the limit.

# Features
Case-Insensitive Partial Matching:
Supports case-insensitive search for topics, authors, and titles.
Example: Searching for topic=child will return books with subjects like Child education and bookshelves like Childrenâ€™s literature.
Multiple Filter Criteria:
Allows combining multiple filter criteria in a single API call.
Example: Filter on language=en,fr and topic=child,infant.
