Book Retrieval API
This project implements a RESTful API for a book retrieval system using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The API allows searching for books based on various filter criteria, supporting pagination, and returning books in JSON format.

Project Overview
The Book Retrieval API provides the following functionality:

Retrieve Books: Search for books based on zero or more filter criteria.

Filter Options:

Book ID (Project Gutenberg ID numbers)
Language
Mime-type
Topic (filters on "subject" or "bookshelf" or both)
Author
Title
API Response:

Number of books matching the criteria.
A list of book objects with detailed information:
Title of the book
Information about the author
Genre
Language
Subject(s)
Bookshelf(s)
Download links for the book in available formats (mime-types).
Pagination: Retrieve books in sets of 25 if the results exceed the limit.

Features
Case-Insensitive Partial Matching:
Supports case-insensitive search for topics, authors, and titles.
Example: Searching for topic=child will return books with subjects like Child education and bookshelves like Childrenâ€™s literature.
Multiple Filter Criteria:
Allows combining multiple filter criteria in a single API call.
Example: Filter on language=en,fr and topic=child,infant.
Pagination:
If more than 25 books match the criteria, the API returns the first 25 results and provides a mechanism to retrieve additional sets of results.
Sorting:
Books are returned in decreasing order of popularity (measured by the number of downloads).
